# C-Binary Trees

## TASKS
Here is the tasks of this project.

### 0-binary_tree_node.c
Write a function that creates a binary tree node.
- When created, a node does not have any child.
- Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

### 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
- Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
- If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

### 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
- Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
- If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.
